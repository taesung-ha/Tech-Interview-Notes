## Merge / Join Mistakes

- Lyft Driver Wages ‚Äì Used INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN [(StrataScratch)](https://www.stratascratch.com/?via=signupnow&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAA_CeujGTpJbwKfJvLlHyqRKxeS55b&gclid=CjwKCAjwn6LABhBSEiwAsNJrjpcjMuRtBp0l2wJGRVR4Pz5r8l3axl5GtDQWx-04MKIarole2Pm1WxoCKGkQAvD_BwE) [[Go to Mistake]](Python-Mistakes.md#1-problem-lyft-driver-wages)

  ‚Üí Rows were dropped due to default join behavior.

## Date & Time Handling

- [Customer Revenue in March ‚Äì Forgot how to convert 'YYYY-mm-dd' to 'YYYY-mm'](Python-Mistakes.md#4-problem-customer-revenue-in-march)  
  ‚Üí Filtering didn‚Äôt work as expected due to string comparison.

---

## GroupBy & Aggregation

## Sorting & Filtering

  ‚Üí used `in` incorrectly to compare multiple values.  
  [[Go to Mistake]](Python-Mistakes.md#1-problem-order-details)

- [Income By Title and Gender ‚Äì use `df['column'].notna()` to identify not NAN values.](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10077-income-by-title-and-gender?code_type=2)
