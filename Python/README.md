# 🐍 Python Mistake Log (StrataScratch-focused)

This folder contains my personal mistake log while solving StrataScratch problems using Python (mainly Pandas).

🧪 Purpose:
- Document incorrect logic and fixes
- Track recurring issues (e.g., wrong join type, dtype errors)
- Build muscle memory through pattern recognition

Focus is on **what I got wrong**, not full solutions.
